# Easy Diet — Product Vision

## Overview

Easy Diet is a **mobile-first nutrition planning application** that automatically builds and adjusts weekly diets based on the user's goals, training routine, and chosen diet type.

The core idea is simple:  
**the user chooses what to eat, the system takes care of balance and adjustments.**

---

## Problem

Most diet apps today fall into one of these categories:

- Manual calorie tracking (time-consuming and error-prone)
- Static meal plans that do not adapt
- Excessive focus on recipes instead of structure
- Complex interfaces that overwhelm users

Users often know *what* they want to eat, but not *how to balance it correctly* over time.

---

## Solution

Easy Diet solves this by introducing a **nutrition engine** that:

- Automatically generates a weekly diet plan
- Adjusts calories and macros based on training days
- Respects different diet types (normal, vegetarian, keto, etc.)
- Rebalances the plan whenever the user changes a meal

The user has **full freedom**, while the system guarantees **nutritional consistency**.

## Key Principles

- Mobile-first experience
- No manual macro calculations
- No daily calorie logging
- Flexible and editable diet plans
- Automatic adjustments behind the scenes

---

## Target Audience

- People who train regularly

---

## Platforms

Easy Diet is designed as a **mobile application**, with the intention to be published on:

- 🍎 Apple App Store (iOS)
- 🤖 Google Play Store (Android)

The application is built to meet the technical and UX standards required by both platforms.
